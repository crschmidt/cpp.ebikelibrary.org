This code was shamelessly ripped off of Josh's Charlottesville website (https://github.com/jmcarp/ebike-library-cville), as was the entire idea of running an e-bike lending library. (This code is very directly forked from his with some minor modifications, I just was too lazy to actually make it a fork.)
