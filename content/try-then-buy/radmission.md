A RadMission High-Step is available for sale, including the rear rack from
RadPower. The previous owner has moved on to a different bike, and offered
this up to the library as a try-then-buy model. This bike has been discontinued
by the manufacturer and is no longer sold directly, though most parts remain
available from the manufacturer. 

This bike has the basic RadMission controller, so no odomoeter; it likely has
under 300 miles on it. It has a pair of alternative pedals from the previous
owner. It was originally purchased in October of 2022.
