The E-bike library has a number of bikes that you can try and then purchase at
a discount to the price offered by the seller. (Sales help support the e-bike
library.) These bikes are in the library, and can be checked out as normal,
but are also available for purchase directly from the library.

* RadRunner High-Step - $750
* RadWagon 4 - $1700
