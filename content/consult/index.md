title: Get Purchase Advice!
---

Our volunteer librarians have spent dozens of hours talking to people who are
considering purchasing e-bikes about what they want, what options are out
there, and we keep an eye on the broader ecosystem so that we can make the best
recommendations for the bike for you.

We are happy to help advise you on which bike is right for your situation;
helping you find the best fit, and often find the best deal in purchasing an
e-bike that fits your needs. Or if you've already got a bike in mind for 
purcahse -- for example, because you see a good deal on Facebook Marketplace
or Cragistlist -- we can advise on that as well!

If you're considering buying, but just not sure which bike is right for you;
or you think you know what you're going to get and just want someone to help
confirm that you're making the right choice, then feel free to reach out to
us for advice!

When seeking advice, some things to share with our volunteer librarians are:

* What do you plan to use the bike for?
* How far do you expect to be riding it?
* What is your current bike (if any)?
* What type of cargo (kids, or gear) do you intend to carry?
* What budget constraints are you working with?

With these details, we can help you narrow down the purchase that is best for
you!

To help support library operations, we request a small donation be provided
as part of the process, so that we can ensure we can provide the best
available answers. We want to help everyone get on the bike that is right 
for them!
