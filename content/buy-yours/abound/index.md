The Community Pedal Power E-Bike Lending Library has partnered with E-Bikes of New
England to offer a discount on a package deal with accessories for the Aventon
Abound.

Bikes are assembled by professional bike mechanics, and delivered to your door
in the Camberville area, within the week for in-stock bikes. **For each bike
purchased, E-Bikes of New England will donate $50 to the Community Pedal Power E-Bike
Lending Library.**

Currently, some accessories are sold out from Aventon, so some parts of this
deal may be delayed.

| Package | E-Bikes of New England Price |
| ------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Standard**: This base accessory package includes the handrail, rear seat pad, and a front rack, for a ready-to-ride experience designed to haul two older kids.  | $2203 |
| **Ready to Haul**: The Ready to Haul package adds a double-width milk crate mounted to the front rack for all your carrying needs, and a Lezyne bell. | $2250 |
| **Ready to Transport**:  This package adds a rack-mounted Yepp Maxx child seat. (This is the configuration available for borrowing from the E-Bike Lending Library.) | $2450 |

All prices include professional assembly and delivery.

E-Bikes of New England has also donated a Ready to Transport model Aventon Abound to the library for families to try before they buy; if you'd like to try out the bike, you can request to [borrow the bike](https://forms.gle/WkBo3KS4jfbQtgAr7) to try! Thanks to E-Bikes of New England for their support of the library and the Camberville Cycling Community!
