A RadRover 6+ Step-thru is available for sale, including the rear rack, large
rear basket, and front basket. 

The previous owner has moved on to a different bike, and offered this up to the
library. The bike has had a replacement throttle from RadPower after a previous
throttle malfunctioned after a crash, but is believed to be working well at this
time.

This bike has around 300 miles on it.
