What an amazing resource -- my family was able to enjoy time in the summer cycling together, when otherwise we would have had to drive and been unable to explore all of the awesome bike-connected areas near us that we love to visit by bike. Chris was gracious, welcoming, enthusiastic and communicative with the lending experience. I've been recommending the e-bike library to anyone I meet who has an interest in e-bikes but isn't ready to purchase one!

We purchased an Aventon Abound through a deal that the Ebike Library helped set up with EBikes of New England. The Library has also played a role in documenting and organizing group buys to improve the Abound (Better Abound Project), making it a true all-weather commuter. We were debating getting a second car, but the Abound has proven to be a fun and reliable car replacement, covering 1000 miles in 10 months.

E-Bike Library is an incredible resource. My family borrowed an Urban Arrow cargo bike for a short period of time to fill a specific use case. Our other options were to spend thousands of dollars for a similar bike, or drive a car around. 
For folks looking to buy, it's so awesome to be able to try a particular bike (for more than a few minutes at a bike shop!) before investing in their own e-bike.

The e-bike library was essential in figuring out which bike I needed to improve my life with two children the most. I also received invaluable advice on where to purchase my bike, how to keep it from getting stolen, where and how to store it and what accessories to get for it.

I followed a friend's advice and tried an e-bike for a few days. These days were so joyful I couldn't help but think, how can I get one of these bikes? I did and for the last 4 months, I've rode 600+ miles in Camberville and beyond. I was an avid biker before but the hills of Somerville + carrying a child felt too much on a regular bike. I'm so grateful for the free library community!

The ebike library isn't just about borrowing and testing bikes. I found the librarians to be extremely helpful and insightful in helping me pick out a bike. They knew so much more than I expected. Without the ebike library, I probably would have purchased a bike but I wouldn't have felt as confident in my selection.

I tried three different e-bikes from the library and commuted to work on them for a month. I did not actually love any of them, but I learned much more about what I really wanted than I could have from any number of short bike shop test rides. I ended up buying an e-bike that I'm very happy with and a year later I'm loving commuting to work on it.

My toddler, who was feeling very cautious about getting on a cargo bike, finally agreed to ride on the trip back to the lending library to drop off my loaner Aventon Abound. He must have had the best time of his life on that trip, making up and singing songs about riding on a bike at the top of his lungs. When we arrived at the lending library and had to give the bike back, he completely melted down and had to be dragged away from the bike. He continued to talk about that magical trip every week, ("Mama, what day is it? What day do we go on the bike? Do we go on the bike TODAY?")   and his excitement was the push I needed to actually buy my own for the family. When I picked him up from school in our Urban Arrow for the first time, I had to spend a long time reassuring him that we weren't just going to take this one directly back to the lending library! Thanks for all the work you do creating new young e-bike enthusiasts all over town!

We borrowed a Tern GSD which gave me the comfort needed to make the e-bike plunge. It’s completely changed our ability to transport some combination of our 3 kids, including a 10-year-old with confidence and ease.

The library was instrumental in our e-cargo bike purchase. I have some mobility issues and borrowing a bike for a week really enabled us to see whether my body could handle the physicality without making a large purchase which we then regretted. I cannot recommend the library enough, almost every week someone asks me about my bike and I point them in the direction of the library.

I’m so glad we borrowed the Tern GSD. We were heading in a completely different direction, but actually getting to borrow this bike showed us that a mid-tail was right for us. Riding it was important, but so was seeing it in our shed and maneuvering it in our yard. I’m so thankful to the library and to the librarians for the generosity with which they share their knowledge!

The e bike library was life changing! We were a two car family, with one car's lease coming up for renewal. We heard about the library and it got us thinking about whether we could have one car, and one e bike. Borrowing the abound with the exact setup for a child was perfect. We were able to try it out as if it was our own. Once we made the decision, Chris helped us navigate getting the bike during a Black Friday sale, with all the same accessories the library bike has. I can't stop talking about the library to anyone who will listen. It is such an amazing community service!
