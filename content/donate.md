Help support the lending library!

In 2023, we helped more than 100 people try out e-bikes, many for the first
time. Dozens of people bought e-bikes and have become avid riders, in some
cases avoiding the need to buy a second car (or even selling the second car
they already have).

This included purchasing bikes, helmets, locks, repair services, and more, as 
we worked to grow the library to meet the needs of the community.

In 2024, we're hoping to do even more: bringing more rides to the community,
expanding our offering of bikes, and making sure that people can try out a 
bike when they need it.

We are a part of Community Pedal Power, a 501c3 non-profit organization; all
donations are tax deductible.
