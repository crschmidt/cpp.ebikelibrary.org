The E-Bike Lending Library is a volunteer-run project, and is not run for
profit. I'm thankful for the support of the biking community of Greater Boston
for their support, and for the support from various users of the lending 
library! If you would like to help fund the Lending Library, please feel
free to <a href="/donate/">give a tax-deductible donation</a>.

# Support the Library: Donate a Bike

If you work at a bike company, we'd love to talk about featuring your bike
in our library as well! With a [waitlist](/waitlist/) of more than 100 people,
we are always looking for opportunities to bring more high quality bikes 
that we can recommend to people into our library. If you've got a bike you'd
like to see on this list, [email our librarians](mailto:librarians@communitypedalpower.org) to chat!

In general, our borrowers are most focused on moderately priced long-tail
cargo bikes, upright commuter bikes, and lighter weight hybrid bikes, but if
you've got a specific model you think could fit our needs, let us know!

Models we are especially interested in right now:

* RadPowerBikes RadKick
* RadPowerBikes RadWagon 5
* Specialized Haul LT
* Xtracycle Hopper
* Xtracycle RFA
* Yuba Kombi E5

In order to focus our operations on bikes that are high-demand and that we
would recommend for our borrowers to purchase, we do not accept donations 
of bikes that are no longer sold by manufacturers. If you do have a bike 
that you believe we might be interested in accepting as a donation, feel
free to [email us](mailto:librarians@communitypedalpower.org)!
