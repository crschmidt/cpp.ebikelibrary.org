The E-Bike Lending Library is a volunteer-run project, and is not run for
profit. I'm thankful for the support of the biking community of Greater Boston
for their support, and for the support from various users of the lending 
library! If you would like to help fund the Lending Library, please feel
free to donate via the <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/improve-the-camberville-ebike-library">Camberville E-Bike Library GoFundMe</a>.
