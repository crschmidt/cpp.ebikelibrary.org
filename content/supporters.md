The E-Bike Lending Library is a volunteer-run project, and is not run for
profit. I'm thankful for the support of the biking community of Greater Boston
for their support, and for the support from various users of the lending 
library! If you would like to help fund the Lending Library, please feel
free to <a href="/donate/">give a tax-deductible donation</a>.

<h2>E-Bikes of New England</h2>
Several bikes available from the Community Pedal Power E-Bike Lending Library, including the Aventon Abound and the Tern HSD, were generously
provided by <a href="https://www.ebikesofne.com/">Electric Bikes of New England</a>! Electric Bikes of New England is the country's largest Aventon retailer, and offers delivery to the Camberville area. E-Bikes of New England has been an excellent partner to the library, and each purchase you make through them helps support the library as well!

<h2>Velotric</h2>
Velotric donate the Velotric Discover 1 to the library, and has been working to take feedback from our community on the ways to make sure their bikes are a great fit for our community members!
