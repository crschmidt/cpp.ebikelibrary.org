# Curious about e-bikes? Try one from the E-bike Lending Library!

The E-bike Lending Library is a volunteer-run, non-profit service working to
expand access to e-bikes in the area. We have a small collection of e-bikes
that we lend out to community members for up to a week, for free. We're
funded by contributions from our members; and staffed as a labor of love in
order to help people move more of their transportation needs to bikes.

Our volunteer librarians work to connect you with a bike that works for you,
whether you're a solo rider or a family; whether you're riding 1 mile every
day or 20.

By borrowing a bike, you can experience your daily commute, go grocery
shopping, or just take a bike for a spin and decide whether e-bikes are right
for you. [Sign up](https://forms.gle/WkBo3KS4jfbQtgAr7) to borrow an e-bike or
[contact us](mailto:librarians@communitypedalpower.org) with any questions.

The library has three pickup locations: in Somerville near Porter Square, and
in Roslindale near Roslindale Village, and in the South End near Blackstone
Square.

### Bought an E-Bike?

Did you buy an e-bike and are looking to buy a Litelok X1 to help protect 
it? [Head over here](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=2XFPFWWXMWQWN).


### How it works

* Contact us to let us know which e-bike(s) you'd like to try.
* We'll get in touch to schedule a time to borrow an e-bike.
* Visit the library in to pick up an e-bike. If you haven't
    ridden an e-bike before, expect this to take 15-30 minutes, or
    longer if you want to try more than one e-bike.
* Enjoy e-biking for up to a week, then bring the e-bike back to the
    library.
* You can borrow an e-bike more than once, or borrow multiple e-bikes;
  however, some bikes may have a longer waitlist.
