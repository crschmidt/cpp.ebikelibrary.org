# Curious about e-bikes? Try one from the Cambridge E-bike Lending Library!

The E-bike Lending Library is a free, not-for-profit service working to expand
access to e-bikes in the area. We have a small collection of e-bikes that we
lend out to community members for up to a week, for free.

E-bikes are a great way to get around the Boston area. But there are
many brands and styles to choose from, and because many e-bikes are sold
online, it can be a challenge to try an e-bike before buying one.

By borrowing a bike, you can experience your daily commute, go grocery
shopping, or just take a bike for a spin and decide whether e-bikes are right
for you. [Sign up](https://forms.gle/WkBo3KS4jfbQtgAr7) to borrow an e-bike or
[contact us](mailto:camberville@ebikelibrary.org) with any questions.

### How it works

* Contact us to let us know which e-bike(s) you'd like to try.
* We'll get in touch to schedule a time to borrow an e-bike.
* Visit the library in Porter Square to pick up an e-bike. If you haven't
    ridden an e-bike before, expect this to take 15-30 minutes, or
    longer if you want to try more than one e-bike.
* Enjoy e-biking for up to a week, then bring the e-bike back to the
    library.
* You can borrow an e-bike more than once, or borrow multiple e-bikes.

To be eligible, you must be 18 or older, and have a secure place to
store an e-bike at home, and at work or school if you plan to commute.
You should also be comfortable riding a standard bicycle before trying
an e-bike.

The E-bike Library is run by me, Christopher Schmidt, using my own e-bikes.
The e-bikes are free to borrow, but you're welcome to make a small donation to
help cover maintenance costs if you would like. The e-bikes are stored in my
shed at my home in Porter Square.
