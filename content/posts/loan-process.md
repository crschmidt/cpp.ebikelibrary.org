Since all of our librarians are unpaid volunteers, we aim to minimize the amount
of time that librarians need to schedule in their day for library loans. 
Please keep this in mind and be respectful of their time. You will receive
a communication from a librarian with your scheduled pickup time.

* Arrive as close to the scheduled pickup time as possible.
* Expect your bike pickup to take about 30 minutes.
* If you are going to be more than 15 minutes late, communicate that as early
  as possible, via text message to the librarian.
* If you are not able to arrive within 30 minutes of your scheduled time,
  this may mean that your pickup will need to be rescheduled to another
  date. Communicate with the librarian and ask if you need to reschedule your
  pickup.
* Bikes are often loaned out again the same day as they are returned, so
  please arrive at or before your scheduled return time.
* When returning, remember to bring charger, keys, lock, and helmet (if
  borrowed).
* While librarians will typically be happy to have a conversation about your
  loan, other bikes to consider, or other similar matters, this is dependent
  on scheduling; if a librarian asks you to follow-up via email, you can do
  so by [emailing the librarians](mailto:librarians@communitypedalpower.org) to
  continue the conversation0.
