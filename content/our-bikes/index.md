### Long-tail/Cargo

These bikes are offered with a child seat installed that fits children up to 45 pounds. If you would like to borrow a bike without a child seat installed (e.g. because you have two older children), please include that comment in your borrowing form.

### Normal Hybrid-style Bikes

* <img src="/ebikes/soltera.png" width="200px" alt="A bright yellow bike with a high bar" style="float: right; margin-left: 3px; margin-bottom: 3px" />

  **Aventon Soltera**: A lightweight, 7-speed e-bike with a high-step frame. This bike has a torque assist drive and a less powerful motor than most of our other e-bikes. This may be a good bike for cyclists who are interested in adding a bit more range to their ride while still feeling like they're riding a bike. [Borrow this bike](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe0Qj86MtCJm0T9w3RhqHQfDc6EEZ5kHJZDi0nMpL_0Wvt3-g/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.504891430=Aventon+Soltera.2:+High+step+torque+assist+hybrid-style+bike)

    <div style="clear: both; margin-bottom: 5px;">&nbsp;</div>

* **Velotric T1 ST**: The lightest bike in the E-bike library, this 7-speed e-bike with a mid-step frame has a torque assist drive, and a smooth assist system. However, unlike other bikes in the library, this bike has an integrated battery, which means it must be brought to an outlet to charge (rather than bringing a battery inside). [Borrow this bike](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe0Qj86MtCJm0T9w3RhqHQfDc6EEZ5kHJZDi0nMpL_0Wvt3-g/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.504891430=)

### Folding Bikes

* **Velotric Fold 1**: Folding bike from Velotric. Note that while this bike folds, it is still bulky and somewhat heavy; the bike weighs 63 pounds. [Borrow this bike](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe0Qj86MtCJm0T9w3RhqHQfDc6EEZ5kHJZDi0nMpL_0Wvt3-g/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.504891430=)

### Retired Bikes

We have a number of bikes in the library that are no longer sold by
manufacturers, or that we do not recommend for buyers seeking out new bikes.
While we may still have these bikes available for loan, we do not encourage
borrowing these bikes. However, if you have specific questions about the 
experience of riding them, we may still have them available for loans.

* **RadCity Step-Thru 3**: Upright step-thru commuter bike. This bike is no longer sold; the latest model is the [RadCity 5 Plus](https://www.radpowerbikes.com/products/radcity-plus-electric-commuter-bike).
* **RadMission**: Single-speed e-bike with a mid-step frame. This is a straightforward hybrid-style bike with e-assist. This bike is no longer sold; the best alternative is the Aventon Soltera or Velotric T1 ST.
* **Radio Flyer L885**: This first generation Radio Flyer cargo bike has been replaced in the lineup by the Radio Flyer Via, which is a significant improvement across the board. In particular, this bike has cable brakes rather than hydraulic, which are a bad fit for novice cargo bikers. (This bike was donated by Radio Flyer.)
* **Velotric Packer**: This cargo bike uses a cadence sensor that produces an aggressive and jumpy assist, and has a kickstand which does not meet the needs of a cargo bike well. We do not recommend this bike. (This bike was donated by <a href="https://www.velotricbike.com/?ref=CHRISTOPHERRSCH&utm_source=goaffpro">Velotric</a>.)
* **RadRunner 2**
* **RadRover 6**
* **Velotric Discover 1**
